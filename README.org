* pkgbuilds
A collection of ~PKGBUILD~s to install my configuration

** Installation
first download all the ~PKGBUILD~ with:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/amtoine/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
#+end_src

** Usage
*** on ArchLinux
use the ~install.sh~ script to install packages with ~pacman~

simply give the names of the packages you want to install after the call to the script:
- ~./install.sh x86_64/amtoine-wallpapers-git~ would install my wallpapers alone
- ~./install.sh x86_64/amtoine-wallpapers-git x86_64/amtoine-icons-git~ would install my wallpapers and my icons
- ~./install.sh x86_64/*~ or ~./install.sh~ would install all the packages.

Once the packages are installed, one can clean the repo from build files with ~./clean.sh~.
