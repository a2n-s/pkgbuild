* pkgbuilds
A collection of all the ~PKGBUILD~ needed to recover the software and libs of my linux config.

** Installation
first download all the ~PKGBUILD~ with:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/goatfiles/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
#+end_src

** Usage
*** on ArchLinux
use the ~install.sh~ script to install packages with ~pacman~

simply give the names of the packages you want to install after the call to the script:
- ~./install.sh x86_64/goat-scripts-git~ would install my scripts
- ~./install.sh x86_64/goat-wallpapers-git x86_64/goat-icons-git~ would install my wallpapers and my icons
- ~./install.sh x86_64/*~ or ~./install.sh~ would install all the packages.

Once the packages are installed, one can clean the repo from build files with ~./clean.sh~.
